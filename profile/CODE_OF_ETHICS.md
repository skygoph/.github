### Preamble

Software have a central and growing role in commerce, industry, government, medicine, education, 
entertainment and society at large. Software developers are those who contribute by direct 
participation or by teaching, to the analysis, specification, design, development, certification, 
maintenance and testing of software systems. **Because of their roles in developing software 
systems, software developers have significant opportunities to do good or cause harm, to enable 
others to do good or cause harm, or to influence others to do good or cause harm**. To ensure, as 
much as possible, that their efforts will be used for good, software developers must commit 
themselves to making software development a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with 
that commitment, software developers shall adhere to the following Code of Ethics.

**The Code contains eight Principles related to the behavior of and decisions made by professional 
software developers, managers, as well as trainees and students of the profession.** The Principles 
identify the ethically responsible relationships in which individuals, groups, and organizations 
participate and the primary obligations within these relationships. The Clauses of each Principle 
are illustrations of some of the obligations included in these relationships. These obligations are 
founded in the software developer’s humanity, in special care owed to people affected by the work of 
software developers, and the unique elements of the practice of software development. **The Code 
prescribes these as obligations of anyone claiming to be or aspiring to be a software developer.**

It is not intended that the individual parts of the Code be used in isolation to justify errors of 
omission or commission. The list of Principles and Clauses is not exhaustive. The Clauses should not 
be read as separating the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical 
situations. The Code is not a simple ethical algorithm that generates ethical decisions. In some 
situations standards may be in tension with each other or with standards from other sources. These 
situations require the software developer to use ethical judgment to act in a manner which is most 
consistent with the spirit of the Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, given the circumstances.

Ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful consideration of fundamental principles, rather 
than blind reliance on detailed regulations. These Principles should influence software developers 
to consider broadly who is affected by their work; to examine if they and their colleagues are 
treating other human beings with due respect; to consider how the public, if reasonably well 
informed, would view their decisions; to analyze how the least empowered will be affected by their 
decisions; and to consider whether their acts would be judged worthy of the ideal professional 
working as a software developer. In all these judgments concern for the health, safety and welfare 
of the public is primary; that is, the “Public Interest” is central to this Code.

The dynamic and demanding context of software development requires a code that is adaptable and 
relevant to new situations as they occur. However, even in this generality, the Code provides 
support for software developers and managers of software developers who need to take positive action 
in a specific case by documenting the ethical stance of the profession. The Code provides an ethical 
foundation to which individuals within teams and the team as a whole can appeal. The Code helps to 
define those actions that are ethically improper to request of a software developer or teams of 
software developers.

The Code is not simply for adjudicating the nature of questionable acts; it also has an important 
educational function. As this Code expresses the consensus of the profession on ethical issues, it 
is a means to educate both the public and aspiring professionals about the ethical obligations of 
all software developers.

1. **Public**

Software developers shall act consistently with the public interest. In particular, software 
developers shall, as appropriate:

    a.  Accept full responsibility for their own work.
    b.  Moderate the interests of the software developer, the employer, the client and the users 
        with the public good.
    c.  Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief that it is safe, meets 
        specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality of life, diminish 
        privacy or harm the environment. The ultimate effect of the work should be to the public 
        good.
    d.  Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential danger to the user, 
        the public, or the environment, that they reasonably believe to be associated with software 
        or related documents.

        installation, maintenance, support or documentation.
    f.  Be fair and avoid deception in all statements, particularly public ones, concerning software 
        or related documents, methods and tools.
    g.  Consider issues of physical disabilities, allocation of resources, economic disadvantage and

        counter-productive or dangerous.

7. **Colleagues**

Software developers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues. In particular, software 
developers shall, as appropriate:

    a.  Encourage colleagues to adhere to this Code.
    b.  Assist colleagues in professional development.
    c.  Credit fully the work of others and refrain from taking undue credit.

        and procedures for protecting passwords, files and other confidential information, and 
        security measures in general.
    g.  Not unfairly intervene in the career of any colleague; however, concern for the employer, 
        the client or public interest may compel software developers, in good faith, to question the 
        competence of a colleague.
    h.  In situations outside of their own areas of competence, call upon the opinions of other 
        professionals who have competence in that area.

software developers shall continually endeavor to:

    a.  Further their knowledge of developments in the analysis, specification, design, development,
